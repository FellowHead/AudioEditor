# AudioEditor

An audio editor written in Java

## Getting Started

This project is using some classes from [TarsosDSP](https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP) (for proper time stretching) and from [ForwardIO](https://github.com/FellowHead/ForwardIO) (saving and loading files).

(I haven't figured out how to solve this with Maven or other package managers, so I'll just link to the needed JARs)

[TarsosDSP-2.4.jar](https://0110.be/releases/TarsosDSP/TarsosDSP-2.4/TarsosDSP-2.4.jar)

[ForwardIO.jar](https://github.com/FellowHead/ForwardIO/raw/master/ForwardIO.jar)
